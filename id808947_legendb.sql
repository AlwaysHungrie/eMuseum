It revolves around a sword, a metaphor of never ending threat, and the protagonist, Damocles. \r\nDamocles is a flatterer courtier of Dionysus the Elder of the 4th century B.C. tyrant king of Syracuse. Dionysus asks Damocles whether he would he like to try out Dionysus\' life. Damocles readily agrees. Damocles enjoys everything immensely until he notices a sharp sword hovering over his head that is hanging from the ceiling by a strand of horsehair. This, the tyrant explains to Damocles, is what life as ruler is really like. \r\nRendered in the Neo-Classical style prevalent in the 19th century CE, this history painting shows Damocles reclining on a golden couch, surrounded with luxuries and attractive servants. Above his head is the suspended sword at which he is gazing with apparent horror. \r\nAntoine Dubost was a French artist who studied at the École des Beaux Arts. ‘The Sword of Damocles’ was exhibited in 1804 in an exhibition at the Leicester Square, London. Dubost received a gold medal from Napoleon and the coveted praise of Jacques Louis David, the great master of Neo-Classicism.\r\nThomas Hope, a Dutch and British merchant banker, author, philosopher and art collector, purchased the painting. Hope chopped off some part of the painting along its top and bottom edge in order to accommodate it into a symmetrical hang in his home, altered the position of the sword from perpendicular to diagonal, replaced the horsehair with a knot and, on top of everything, influenced by Dubost’s critics, doubted his ability as an artist of a creation of such a masterly quality and effaced his signature.\r\nIn 2006, the cleaning of the canvas was undertaken by the Museum’s conservation department which uncovered the artist’s signature inscribed on the footstool, partially in Greek: ‘ΔUBOST EΠOIEI’ meaning ‘Dubost made it’ which is now clearly visible.

The twisted silk warp has heavy silk as weft often in contrast colours. This sari is a typical example of a traditional Baluchar sari. It has a violet ground decorated with diagonal repeats of small kalga patterns in white, cream, dark pink, green, blue and maroon. A broad border runs all around with stylized pink flowers in a continuous meander. The centre of the elaborate pallu has five large kalga or paisley motifs, four of which are woven in pink and maroon silk. The fifth one done only in maroon is what is known as nazarbatu, a motif with some flaw. The Baluchar weavers intentionally allowed a nazarbatu or a flaw in the colour or design, to ward off the evil eye. The design around the central row of kalgas depicts a contemporary scene of a steam engine and train which must have been a novelty at that time. The European passengers wearing tall hats are seated in the two-tiered coach of a train. In between these, some composite animal and human figures also appear. Enakshi Bhavnani also reports a similar sari showing a railway scene in her book ‘Decorative Designs And Craftsmanship of India’.\r\nThough produced in Bengal the composition of the decorative design on the Baluchar sari is typically that of Gujarat. The saris in Bengal emphasise the border decoration while the pallu is generally quite simple. The style of draping a sari in Bengal emphasises the beauty of the border rather than the pallu ends, whereas the pallu is emphasised in the manner Gujarati women drape their saris. A large number of Gujarati merchants had settled near Murshidabad where these saris originated. It is possible that these Gujarati merchants ordered these Baluchar saris for their women which would explain the introduction of a large decorative pallu in this type of sari produced in Bengal.\r\n', 'textile', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'textile', 'textile, sari, baluchar, bengal, sahib, heirloom', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Default.jpg'),
